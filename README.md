ICA
test out on a toy problem whether overlap copying matters, maybe it does, because if you want to be able to extract a component with eye-artifacts it depends on how many there are in the signal, so with overlap copying you create more of somethings, so this could be problematic

eye artifacts
there is a function for detecting eye artifacts, could be handy for checking the succes of the ica
should check whether componts really remove eye artifacts, especially horizontal eye artifacts by plotting time course of bad trials of the components
